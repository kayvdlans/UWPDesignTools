# UWPDesignTools
First version of some tools I made to help with designing and testing for a Hololens 2. Pretty outdated by now. 

Sample Scenes for the color picker and Layer structure are available, but all tools need to be updated to be made more user friendly and fix some issues before they are actually ready for use.

Features: 
- Extension/Rewrite of the Colorpicker prefab to make it easier to use and make it much more readable code. Original is/was an experimental feature of the MRTK package by Microsoft. Still not quite user friendly though, needs to be updated.
- Layer Structure, which is a first version of layered menu for use in the Hololens 2
- Button Resizer, which makes it easier to resize MRTK's buttons. Currently resizes the frontplate, backplate, and toggle backplate.

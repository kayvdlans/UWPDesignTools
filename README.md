# UWPDesignTools
First version of some tools I made to help with designing and testing within Hololens. Pretty outdated by now. 

Features: 
- Extension/Rewrite of the Colorpicker prefab to make it easier to use and make it much more readable code. Original is/was an experimental feature of the MRTK package by Microsoft. Still not quite user friendly though, needs to be updated.
- Layer Structure, which is a first version of layered menu for use in the Hololens 2
- Button Resizer, which makes it easier to resize MRTK's buttons. Currently resizes the frontplate, backplate, and toggle backplate.
